Salutations, My partner and I (Tiwong Nance, Jr. and Andrew McMinn) created this website for the Academic Decathlon team at Madison Academic High School.
Academic Decathlon is a class where people, who aren't so athletically inclined or just want to challenge themselves further, can be around other
people with the same interests. We're both proud members who strive for greatness in an academic environment, but we also use these skills to program a 
pristine website. 

This website was created for the following reasons: Those interested in competing in Academic Decathlon, parents who want to stay informed on their child's
interest, and to show that Academic Decathlon is more than just studying.


Website Features

 - Our client requested that we implement a website to let viewers know what Academic Decathlon is about. Paula Hatcher (Head-Coach) asked that we 
 specifically add several items to the website: 
	~ Implementing images/videos of Academic Decathlon
	~ Showing the experiences of students on the Academic Decathlon team
	~ Attempting to catch the interest of newcomers
	~ Giving incite on former decathlete's experiences

 - When it first began, this website had many problems on all screen sizes. The website is now fully-functional on all screen sizes to improve the
 experience for all clients interested in learning about Academic Decathlon. 
	~ The footer was a major problem because it wasn't in the correct format for smaller screens, and it was too small for large screens. 
	~ The nav was either too compressed on small screens or was too distant on larger screens. 
	~ The scores table was completely unresponsive, and on smaller screens you could only see half of the table. 
	~ The website overall had several minor responsive issues. (i.e. extra whitespace, broken images, etc.)

 - We wanted our design to be original and different from the other websites (past or present). We decided on using a design that showed the creativity 
 that a successful web designer should demonstrate. We chose the color red because it portrays the school spirit and the National USAD logo. We chose
 a simple, yet professional font so that all user's can view the website with ease. The background is either simple with small whitespace or filled with
 a plethora of images/videos. As we thought through these things, we kept in mind the relation with Academic Decathlon's busy and hectic schedule to the
 website's seemingly compact layout to give the user's the same experience of overload. 

 - We created a logo and a favicon that best represented the Madison Academic Decathlon Team. We chose the book to demonstrate the scholarly advances that 
 we, as AD members, make. The items located inside the book give the viewer an idea of the material, all being attached in a single book/binder. 
	~ The M is comprised of two mustangs, which represents us as a school. 
	~ The A is a embroidered on a shield to represent the protection of all knowledge.
	~ The D is a ruler that represents the perfectionist attitude that an AD student must maintain.
	~ The globe is there to represent the unity of the team and the worldwide representation of Academic Decathlon.
